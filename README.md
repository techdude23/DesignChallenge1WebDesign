<strong>Brooke's Expectations</strong>
Brooke has sent us an email over night and responded to our questions. All answers have been formatted to look clean.
<ol>
  <li>I just want it to be awesome (maybe a spinning globe somewhere on it?)</li>
  <li>All tabs on the top of page and tabs to be Homework, Announcements, Upcoming work, Extra Credit assignments, Calendar, Make an appointment with Brooke</li>
  <li>Have students set up an appointment to meet and have the website email me to know who wants an appointment and an ongoing calendar too</li>
  <li>I would love pictures of historically famous people from the beginning of time to the 1500s. Like: What an early human looks like, Aristotle, plato, socretes, Julius cesear, Justinian, Leonardo Di Vinci, etc. The background I would really love to look like an old atlas such as this: http://i.imgur.com/eINJhiB.jpg or http://i.imgur.com/fVMZXdo.gif</li>
  <li>The site should be one that my students can go to when they have questions about work so they do not have to email me</li>
  <li> I want my users to see upcoming assignments/important announcements. Also I would love the syllabus to be displayed on the first page </li>
  <li> I LOVE the second half of this website you sent me http://www.elkriver.k12.mn.us/webpages/karlsagan/news.cfm From the Calendar, down.</li>
</ol>
